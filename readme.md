# Setup

You're gonna need a discord access token. If you are meant to contribute to
this, you'll know where to get this. Otherwise stop reading.

To use the token, you have to create a file named Discord.token in the
DiscordMud subdirectory of this repository with the token text as contents.
After that running the bot should be as easy as opening up the solution and
pressing f5.
